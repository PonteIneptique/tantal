TanTAL
======

**TanTAL** is meant to be a drop-in replacement for Pie/PaPie with a simplified API, removing paths that were tested in both
but which did not show any improvement over some other configurations. TanTAL also includes other options, specifically
regarding how text is encoded through n-gram encoders.
